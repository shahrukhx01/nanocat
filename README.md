# Nanocat

üê± A minimal implementation of [pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) for learning and educational purposes.

## About

Nanocat is an educational project that recreates a simplified version of pipecat - an open-source framework for building voice and multimodal conversational agents. While pipecat offers a comprehensive suite of features for production use, nanocat focuses on implementing core voice bot functionality to help developers:

- Understand how pipecat is engineered under the hood
- Learn the internals and architecture of voice agent systems
- Get hands-on experience with fundamental voice AI concepts
- Explore a minimal working implementation without the complexity of a full production framework

This project serves as both a learning resource and a starting point for those interested in voice AI development or contributing to pipecat itself.
